#I want the focus of the Mongo.2 directory to sort of be an attempt 2 at what I was trying to do before, but I want to change my approach
#I went into the technical way too quickly and way too exhaustively last time. I was trying to optimize before even reaching my goal or even knowing what it was

#your brain about how to do CRUD in the most efficient way possible and doing code golf and trying to solve for problems that dont yet exist
